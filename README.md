# Canadian Elections

## Description:
This project uses Python to draw Canada and all of its official ridings in an election, then colours them based on which party won in that riding.

The election maps of Canada are highly detailed, and you can zoom into any part of the country seamlessly.

Will add previous and future elections to this project.

### November 2025 UPDATE:
* Added the 1935 election to the project!
* Fully automated pull_voting_data.py, archived the old version of the script.

### October 2025 UPDATE:
* Added parliament charts for each currently available election! Just click the `>` button to see 
the seat makeup in parliament.
* Added the 1900, 1904, 1908, 1911, 1917, 1921, 1925, 1926, and 1930 elections to the project!
* Added favicons, so a maple leaf will appear for this tab in all browsers.

### September 2025 UPDATE:
* Added the 1872, 1874, 1878, 1882, 1887, 1891 AND 1896 elections to the project! You can view them under the NEW dropdown menu. Just hover your mouse over the "More" button and select an election.
