# Canadian Elections

## Description:
This project uses Python to draw Canada and all of its official ridings, then colours them based on which party won in that riding.

The map of Canada is highly detailed, and allows you to zoom into any part of the country seamlessly.

Will add previous and future elections to this project.
Will also improve performance so zooming in/out of the map doesn't have as much lag.

## How to run this project:
1. Clone this repository
2. Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary libraries
3. Run CanadianElection2019.py
4. Copy the path of the election2019.html file
5. Paste the path into your browser to view the electoral map
