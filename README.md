# Canadian Elections

## Description:
This project uses Python to draw Canada and all of its official ridings in an election, then colours them based on which party won in that riding.

The election maps of Canada are highly detailed, and you can zoom into any part of the country seamlessly.

Will add previous and future elections to this project.
